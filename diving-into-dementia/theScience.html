      <h1>THE TYPES OF DEMENTIA</h1>
      <p><i>There are actually many types of dementia, and it's quite difficult to distinguish them all. What are the main differences of Alzheimers, vascular, lewy body, 
        frontotemporal dementia? How do you distinguish them? </i>
      </p>

      <div class="card">

        <h2 class="titleScience">Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
        <p>Alzheimer’s disease is the most commonly found type of dementia. Around 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases are linked
        back to Alzheimer’s and affect mainly older adults. However, experts have found that there are early-onset forms of this
        disease that develop as young as 30 years old. This may be caused by mutations in genes that are passed through genetics
        and family history...</p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Alzheimer’s causes amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in a patient’s brain. These plaques consist of
          deteriorating neurons and cells along with clumps of a type of protein called beta-amyloid. A specific form,
          beta-amyloid 42, is thought to be toxic and is unusually prevalent in the brain of an Alzheimer’s patient. The
          neurofibrillary tangles are twisted filaments located in neurons made up of tau, which is also another type of protein.
          Normally, the tau works in healthy neurons to help the microtubules transfer substances to the nerve cell. But with
          Alzheimer’s disease, tau is altered to twist and fold into paired helical filaments, which causes the tangles. This
          impairs the microtubules, forcing the neuron transport system to break down. Both the plaques and tangles intensify as
          the disease grows, leading cells to die and display the effects of Alzheimer’s.</p>
          <img id="alz"src="images/1.png" alt="">
          <p>Alzheimer’s disease can be described as brain cell death. This condition slowly worsens and degenerates the patient’s
          cognitive abilities over a rough span of seven to ten years. As time passes, noticeable declines in memory, movement,
          behavior, and language are experienced. Patients will have difficulty performing everyday tasks and also become easily
          disoriented. Changes in personality are also possible, like having a short temper and developing hostility. Once in the
          later stages of Alzheimer’s, motor functions are eventually damaged. People will lose the ability to swallow and have
          weak bladder control. Normally, overarching symptoms like depression, delusions, and sleeplessness are adopted.</p>

        <h2 class="titleScience">Vascular Dementia</h2>
        <p>After Alzheimer’s, vascular dementia is the second most common type of dementia. Although, it is rarely diagnosed as a
        single form of dementia. Only around 5% to 10% of people experience vascular dementia on its own, as it’s more often
        found as a part of mixed dementia or Alzheimer’s. Vascular dementia mainly affects older people, around 65 years and up...</p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Vascular dementia is rooted in inadequate blood flow to the brain. This is normally picked up from underlying conditions
          or lifestyle. For example, strokes are often linked to the development of vascular dementia. Most strokes are caused by
          a clot that has restricted and blocked a blood artery in the brain. This generates an abrupt halt of blood flow to a
          part of the brain. Although not all strokes lead to dementia, risks are heightened and make people more susceptible to
          them in the future. Some other things that can be connected to vascular dementia are smoking, diabetes, and high blood
          pressure. All of these conditions disrupt the oxygen supply in addition to blood flow to the brain, resulting in damaged
          blood vessels. In turn, the brain receives an unusual lack of nutrition, making it difficult to carry out cognitive
          processes. This eventually kills brain cells which then translates to visible changes.</p>
          <img id="alz" src="images/2.png" alt="">
          <p>Indications of vascular dementia can range from gradual or very sudden development depending on the person and cause.
          The symptoms of vascular dementia differ according to the area of the brain where blood flow is compromised. This type
          of dementia raises impairments in more thought-process-based aspects. Struggles with problem-solving, organization,
          staying focused, and following instructions are just a few early signs of vascular dementia. This makes analyzing
          situations and communicating with others extremely overwhelming. Some more evident symptoms include hallucinations,
          agitation, difficulty walking with balance, and urinary issues.</p>

        <h2 class="titleScience">Lewy Body Dementia</h2>
        <p>Lewy body dementia (LBD) is another type of progressive dementia. This means that while symptoms may appear to be
        moderate at first, they regularly worsen over several years. Roughly 1.6 million people in the U.S. are affected by LBD
        and most of them are 50 and older, but LBD is sometimes found in younger individuals as well...</p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Despite that, LBD is more
          difficult to diagnose than other dementias. In the early stages of LBD, the symptoms are very similar to those of
          Alzheimer’s or general signs of psychiatric illness. It is frequently misdiagnosed or overlooked as a result. It is not
          until later in the development of LBD, when symptoms become more apparent, that it can be accurately identified. </p>
          <p>Lewy body dementia is caused by an abnormal build-up of Lewy bodies in the brain. Lewy bodies are clumps of protein
          deposits, called alpha-synuclein that form inside neurons. Although the specific cause of the deposits and how they harm
          the brain are still being studied, it is believed that they interfere with chemical signals that are sent from one brain
          cell to another, disrupting the brain's normal operations. The chemical messengers, acetylcholine and dopamine, are
          lacking in those with LBD due to the loss of neurons in the brain. The Lewy bodies developed are often found impairing
          the cerebral cortex, which mainly controls memory and muscular movements. Additionally, the plaques and tangles linked
          to Alzheimer's disease are also present in the brains of people with Lewy bodies.</p>
          <img id="alz" src="images/3.png" alt="">
          <p>Lewy body dementia exhibits many similar symptoms to those of Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s, yet the symptoms have a wide
          range depending on the person. Symptoms will differ in severity and type and can even fluctuate over time. In broader
          categories, those with LBD experience major changes in cognition, movement, and sleep. LBD causes the brain to have
          extreme declines in thinking abilities, which impacts things like decision-making, attention span, and awareness of time
          or place. Along with cognitive decline, around 80% of people with LBD suffer from visual hallucinations. Although less
          frequent than visual hallucinations, nonvisual hallucinations—such as hearing or smelling things that aren't there—can
          also happen. Because of the link between LBD and Parkinson’s, movement problems are also very common. Things like muscle
          stiffness, tremors or shaking, loss of coordination, and shuffling walks are some initial signs of LBD. Lastly, sleeping
          disorders, especially rapid eye movement, become more prevalent. They may encounter excessive daytime drowsiness,
          insomnia, and intense changes in sleeping patterns.</p>

        <h2 class="titleScience">Frontotemporal dementia</h2>
        <p>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an umbrella term to categorize the many different variations of frontotemporal
        disorders. Universally, this is also referred to as Pick’s disease. Around 60% of FTD patients are between the ages of
        45 and 64, which is a younger age group compared to other types of dementia. From past studies, experts have found that
        FTD more commonly runs in families and those with it have mutations in certain genes. For example, one gene that is
        guaranteed to cause FTD if it’s passed down is called “familial FTD”. There is a 1 in 2 probability that the child of
        someone with familial FTD will inherit the same gene...</p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Although there are numerous forms of frontotemporal dementia, they all share a similar characteristic: they impact only
          the front and side regions of the brain. These are specifically called the frontal and temporal lobes which are damaged
          during the development of FTD. This dementia leads to a threatening loss of nerve cells in these parts of the brain. The
          lobes are forced to shrink and deteriorate the regular functions of brain regions. While scientists have knowledge about
          how FTD arises, it is still unclear as to why exactly it is caused. But based on continuous research, scientists have
          noticed patterns in the brain of FTD patients. These changes include the death of neurons and abnormal concentrations of
          proteins like tau and TDP-43. These proteins are present in the body naturally and support healthy cell activity. For
          unknown causes, the proteins can malfunction, causing damage to the neurons in the lobes. In addition, FTD has been
          found to stem from family history and genetic mutations. Various genes have been identified to lead to FTD when mutated,
          like the tau gene, GRN gene, and the C9ORF72 gene.</p>
          <img id="alz" src="images/4.png" alt="">
          <p>Frontotemporal dementia is a type of progressive dementia, meaning that symptoms usually start off mild and worsen over
          time. It is often challenging to know which type of FTD is emerging and it can sometimes be misdiagnosed for other brain
          disorders or Alzheimer’s. The symptoms can be extremely varied by patient and form of FTD, but the most common signs
          include drastic shifts in behavior and personality. This may consist of loss of empathy, lack of interest, inappropriate
          social interactions, obsessive or repetitive tendencies, and unusual eating habits. Some other types of FTD can cause
          declines in speech and language. Patients struggle with using written and spoken language correctly, knowing word
          meanings, and speaking without hesitation. Finally, FTD is also linked to impairing movement, similar to Parkinson’s and
          Lewy body dementia. Some motor-related complications can involve muscle spasms, body tremors, difficulties with balance
          or walking, and trouble swallowing.</p>
