  <h2>Zystyn Lazarte</h2>
  <h3>Lead Interviewer</h3>
  <p>Hey, I'm Zystyn and I'm a sophomore at RAHS. I wanted to do this project because I wanted to raise 
    awareness on dementia. Besides that, I am interested in the medical field (medical research), and thought that
    this would be a good way to practice that. In my free time, I love playing basketball, watching K-dramas, listening to music,
    and napping.

  <h2>Arianajoy De Castro</h2>
  <h3 id="centertext">Lead Web Designer</h3>
  <p>Hey! I'm Ariana, currently a sophomore at RAHS. I wanted to make this website because I wanted to challenge myself
  and also spread awareness on dementia. As a future career, I am curious about the computer science industry, specifically UI/UX design. I like
  learning Japanese, watching K-dramas, and editing fun vlogs of my friends in my free time.

  <h2>Vanessa Nguyen</h2>
  <h3>Lead Researcher</h3>
  <p>Hi, I'm Vanessa, a current sophomore at RAHS. I've been interested in the medical field since I was little,
  and over time, I've enjoyed specifically psychology. I wanted to do this project because I want to learn about
  how dementia affects the brain and how to help those who live with dementia. Other than being a dancer, I like
  concerts, fashion, and traveling all over the world.

  <h2>What's Next?</h2>
  <div class="steps-block">
  <h1>1. Gaining More Experience</h1>
  <p>If we do go through with this project, we are hoping to actually volunteer and work with dementia patients, such as at Momentia. We want to make a meaningful difference for people
  with dementia, and support them even through their changing state.</p>
  </div>
<div class="steps-block">
  <h1>2. Spicing Up the Website</h1>
  <p>When it comes to online design, there's a variety of different possibilities, and we want to branch out and try
  different things. We want to add more about our experience, add more interactive parts, and overall make this website more
  informative and enjoyable.</p>
</div>
<div class="steps-block">
  <h1>3. Opening It Up To the Public</h1>
  <p>As of right now, this website is only accessible through Ariana's computer, as it is not connected to the world wide web interface.
  If this becomes successful, we will have this project opened for the public to see. With enough success, we can even turn to learning about
  other illnesses, such as </p>
