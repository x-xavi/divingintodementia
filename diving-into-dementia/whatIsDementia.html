<h1>WHAT IS IT?</h1>
  <div class="description-a">
    <p>Many think that dementia is one specific disorder. But dementia is a term used to describe a group of cognitive thinking
    conditions. Dementia is the “umbrella term” of the overall memory loss condition, while Alzheimer’s, often used interchangably, is a specific
    condition. Dementia is caused by damage to the nerve cells in the brain. These damages interfere with the brain cell's
    ability to communicate with each other. Our brain has sections that carry out a specific responsibility for our mind to
    function. If a section of the brain is impacted, that section’s responsibility is heavily at risk. Possible implications
    can include the decline of cognitive abilities that are severe enough to impair daily life and independent function.
    They also affect behavior, feelings, and relationships.</p>

    <h2 id="symp">Symptoms and Signs</h2>
    <div class="list">
      <ul>
        <li>Memory loss that affects day to day ability: names, places</li>
        <li>Difficulty of executing familiar tasks: preparing a meal, playing a game, remembering to go on errands, 
          challenges of understanding visual and spatial information.</li>
        <li>Confusion with daily activities: time, day, places, misplacing objects</li>
        <li>Difficulties with abstract thinking: having problems understanding what numbers and symbols mean.</li>
        <li>Changes in lifestyle: mood changes, behavior, personality, loss of initiative in family and friends.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 id="symp">Risk Factors</h2>
    <div class="list">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Age: </b>Dementia is not a normal part of aging and can occur in younger people. But the risk of getting dementia increases
      as a person ages, specifically adults who are over the age of 65.</li>
      <li><b>Family History:</b> If a person has a history of dementia, there are greater risks of getting the disorder. But it is
      important to remember that some people with a family history do not get it, and some without a family history.</li>
      <li><b>Down Syndrome: </b>Many people who have down syndrome can get early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 id="symp">Is It Preventable?</h2>
      <p id="cap"><i>There is no definitive way to prevent dementia, but there are ways you can lower the risk.</i></p>
      <div class="list">
        <ol>
          <li><b> Maintaining a healthy diet and exercising often: </b>Maintaining these factors lowers your chances of becoming obese. When a
          person is overweight, the blood pressure and chances of type 2 diabetes also increase. Alzheimer’s and Vascular dementia
          are possible results of these two conditions.</li>
          <li><b>Stop smoking and drinking excessive alcohol: </b>Excessive alcohol consumption increases your risk of stroke, heart disease,
            and certain cancers, as well as harming your nervous system, including your brain. On the other hand, smoking causes
          your arteries to become narrower, which can raise your blood pressure.</li>
          <li><b>Treating health conditions: </b>High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Lose weight if you're overweight,
        consult with a doctor to help treat depression.</li>
        </ol>
