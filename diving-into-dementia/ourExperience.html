   <h1>DEMENTIA: LIFE IN REVERSE</h1>
   <p>One of our teachers at RAHS has seen dementia first hand, and we had thought he would be great to interview him for our project. Mr. Schwimmer is
    the current Photography, Career Choices, and Yearbook advisor. He reached out to us initially after hearing that we were doing research about dementia,
    and it was the perfect time as none of the interviews had been going our way. Here are the questions we asked as well as how he responded.</p>

  <div class="qanda">
   <h2>Q: What is dementia? How would you explain it to someone who might not know much about it?</h2>
   <p>“I always called it like life in reverse. My dad had dementia when he turned around 64. I think he was 63 when he was
   diagnosed. As you get more into it [having dementia], you lose some of the things that make you and adult and kind of
   turn more childlike. So, like he got more playful and he started doing more artistic things. He also lost a lot of his
   skills that he needed you know, that he couldn't do things on his own. And at the same time I had my first son so I saw
   a lot of similarities in their behavior and like the way that they kind of process information and forget things. It was
   like he was a little kid, you know, just like he needed a lot of help. The things that were really important to you as
   kids, like the music and the foods and the activities that you did when you were like 16, like your age, these really
   formative years, those are the things that he really remembered. He really remembered all the music when he was like 16
   and 17. If we played music, from that time, he could remember all the words to it, or he could remember all the baseball
   teams from that or the players from that time."</p>
  </div>

    <div class="qanda">
   <h2>Q: With your dad having dementia, how did it impact you?</h2>
   <p>“It changed me. It was very difficult to watch somebody that you love go through that process. You know, it's a long
   process. I don't know if you came across this, but they sometimes call Alzheimer's the long goodbye. Have you heard of
   that? [The whole process] because it was like 7-8 years. So it changed my relationship with my dad. We got a lot closer
   and changed my relationship with my family. We all had to come together and help my mom. It just kind of changed how I
   thought about what I wanted to do. I wanted to do stuff that honored his memory. So that's part of being a teacher, I
   try to live up to his values. It just changed how I see everything really. It's a pretty heavy process to go through,
   although there are still good things I learned too."</p>
  </div>
    <div class="qanda">
   <h2>Q: Was there a specific moment that was difficult that you experienced with your Dad?</h2>
   <p>It's very slow, it's very gradual. There are a lot of little things. Obviously, the first time he told me, that was
   really hard. There were parts where, he forgot my sister's name, like forgetting names was really hard. Like, that's
   your daughter and you don't know who that is. And that's just part of the process, right? That's how the disease works.
   So it was hard to see him struggle to do the things that he used to really like doing. He couldn't do it anymore. We
   used to watch sports together and then it just got really hard for him to keep up with who the teams were or what sport
   they were playing. So he withdrew a lot. So that was kind of hard. But at the same time, he also came to life in
   different ways. He did more artistic things and we found other ways to connect. He would get lost and sometimes he slept
   a lot. Because it's really hard, cognitively to try to remember what's going on all the time. So he just got worn down.
   It would be really hard to go and he'd just be sleeping But for every bad thing, there was a good thing too. So you
   gotta take the good with the bad."</p>
  </div>
    <div class="qanda">
     <h2>Q: What were the things you noticed when your Dad showed signs of dementia?</h2>
     <p>"He had a really hard time with passwords, like computer passwords and technology. There were things that after he got
     diagnosed, we were like, “ohhh”. He had such a hard time with Gmail and his iPhone. We were like, what's so hard about
     this? His bank account information is as well. All those little things that you take for granted. And then socially, he
     kind of withdrew because he got really self-conscious. He was having a hard time keeping up with conversations. So he
     kind of like pulled back. He also got [sensitive] to loud noises, like auditory stimulation. Really loud noises were
     really hard for him. And he has six grandchildren and they're all just screaming. So he would always like, put his hands
     over his ears or have to walk out. That was kind of tough. I thought it would be like at the beginning he'd forget names
     and things, but it was like little things and it built up. He would also like to buy and spend money on things that were
     like, why do you need it? Like you don't need that. He would [also] worry about bills that he had paid already. He was
     just really stressed out a lot so he couldn't figure out why."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qanda">
     <h2>Q: How should people support those who have dementia? What should they do?</h2>
     <p>"One of the things that I learned that took a long time to learn is that you can grieve for the person that you've lost,
     right? But you need to love and accept the person that they become. Because they become different people. That took a
     while to learn. But once you accept that there's this new person and they're different and they're, they're still
     connected to you, it's a lot easier. Also, don't try to correct them, just be with them where they are. Wherever they
     are in their head, you go there with them. So it's kind of like if they think they're at the county fair or riding a
     bicycle, you go. “Yeah. Ok. Great. I love that.” So you have to put yourself into their world and their world is
     changing. So that’s my big two biggest pieces of advice, grieve for who you lose, of course, accept who they become, and
     then put yourself in their world."</p>
